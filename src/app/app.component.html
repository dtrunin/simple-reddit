  The #v="thing" syntax says that we want to create a local variable for this view.
  Weâ€™re creating an alias to ngForm, for this view, bound to the variable #form.
  Type of #form is FormGroup.

    <!--
    NgModel creates a new FormControl that is automatically added to the parent FormGroup (in this
    case, on the form) and then binds a DOM element to that new FormControl.
    That is, it sets up an association between the input tag in our view and the FormControl and the association is matched
    by a name, in this case "title".
